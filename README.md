Python Week 3

Week 3 mainly focused on the theory side of programming, like what should the program accomplish and all the thing you can accomplish by automating processes.

Project Planning 

But before we dive deeper into this project, take a moment and urge you to do something important. Pause for a while and brainstorm at least three project ideas that are inspired by your own life. Jot them down on paper or type them out on your device.
    - A notepad application to take notes for efficiently
    - A music app to play music on my phone and categorize them automatically
    - A app that has plans out my week and what to accomplish, achieving goals and planning of study times

User stories can be added to the application in the format of "As a, I want, So that" 

Remember, when writing user stories, focus on the user's goals and reasons, rather than specific interface details or implementation methods. Take a moment to write your own set of user stories for your Python project before proceeding with this course. This practice will be valuable for your project development.

Apart from user stories, another useful planning tool for applications is called a use case. Use cases typically include a title, an actor (a user or system), and a scenario that describes how a goal is achieved.
